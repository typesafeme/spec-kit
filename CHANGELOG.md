## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Enhanced Offline Mode Support**: `specify init` now supports true offline operation without any GitHub API calls
  - New `--offline` flag and `SPECIFY_OFFLINE` environment variable to enable offline mode
  - Reads version from local `version.txt` file in `spec-kit-templates/` directory instead of GitHub API
  - Automatically searches installation directory (`src/specify_cli/spec-kit-templates/`) for local templates
  - **Interactive template selection** when multiple versions exist - use arrow keys to choose
  - Automatically selects latest version when only one template is available
  - Semantic version sorting (latest first) for multi-template scenarios
  - Falls back to GitHub download only when not in offline mode and no local templates found
  - Preserves local template files after extraction (no cleanup, unlike GitHub downloads)
  - Corporate firewall friendly - no internet required once templates are installed
  - Enables faster initialization (no network latency) and true offline development workflows
  - Example usage:
    - `specify init my-project --ai claude --offline`
    - `export SPECIFY_OFFLINE=1 && specify init my-project --ai claude`
    - Place multiple templates in installation directory for version selection
  - See `OFFLINE_MODE.md` for comprehensive documentation

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Intelligent Branch Naming**: `create-new-feature` scripts now support `--short-name` parameter for custom branch names
  - When `--short-name` provided: Uses the custom name directly (cleaned and formatted)
  - When omitted: Automatically generates meaningful names using stop word filtering and length-based filtering
  - Filters out common stop words (I, want, to, the, for, etc.)
  - Removes words shorter than 3 characters (unless they're uppercase acronyms)
  - Takes 3-4 most meaningful words from the description
  - **Enforces GitHub's 244-byte branch name limit** with automatic truncation and warnings
  - Examples:
    - "I want to create user authentication" → `001-create-user-authentication`
    - "Implement OAuth2 integration for API" → `001-implement-oauth2-integration-api`
    - "Fix payment processing bug" → `001-fix-payment-processing`
    - Very long descriptions are automatically truncated at word boundaries to stay within limits
  - Designed for AI agents to provide semantic short names while maintaining standalone usability

### Changed

- Enhanced help documentation for `create-new-feature.sh` and `create-new-feature.ps1` scripts with examples
- Branch names now validated against GitHub's 244-byte limit with automatic truncation if needed

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Support for CodeBuddy (thank you to [@lispking](https://github.com/lispking) for the contribution).
- You can now see Git-sourced errors in the Specify CLI.

### Changed

- Fixed the path to the constitution in `plan.md` (thank you to [@lyzno1](https://github.com/lyzno1) for spotting).
- Fixed backslash escapes in generated TOML files for Gemini (thank you to [@hsin19](https://github.com/hsin19) for the contribution).
- Implementation command now ensures that the correct ignore files are added (thank you to [@sigent-amazon](https://github.com/sigent-amazon) for the contribution).

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/speckit.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kit-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
  - Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

## [0.0.15] - 2025-09-21

### Added

- Support for Roo Code.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-09-21

- Agent folder security notice displayed after project provisioning completion, warning users that some agents may store credentials or auth tokens in their agent folders and recommending adding relevant folders to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

### Changed

- Warning displayed to ensure that folks are aware that they might need to add their agent folder to `.gitignore`.
- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21
