**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ✅ All validation checks passed!
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Clarifications resolved:
  - Template identification: Uses pattern "spec-kit-template-{arg1}-{arg2}-v{version}.zip"
  - Fallback behavior: Throws error when no local template found
  - Naming convention: "spec-kit-template-claude-sh-v0.0.78.zip" format with arguments and version
  - Template selection: Arguments "claude" and "sh" enable multiple template types
  - Version handling: System automatically selects latest version when multiple exist
